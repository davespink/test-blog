The only politicians worth their salt to me are what are called conviction politicians. Career politicians really give
the word a bad name. people who see it as a duty and not a job so they can retire to consultant positions on boards of
companies they helped along the way, or to the comfort of the vermin in the House of Lords. Sorry, I meant to type
“ermine”.

To me, the only politicians who deserve any respect are the conviction politicians. Career politicians have dragged the
word “politician” through the mud—treating it as a cushy gig, a stepping stone to consultant roles on corporate boards
they propped up in office, or a ticket to lounge among the vermin (sorry, I meant “ermine”) in the House of Lords.
Conviction politicians, on the other hand, see it as a duty, not a job. They lay out their beliefs, stick to their guns,
and do what they promised if they get the chance to lead. I don’t have to agree with their politics—and often I
don’t—but I admire their honesty, a quality rarer than a unicorn in Westminster or Washington.

Here’s my list of politicians who, in my view, fit the bill. They come from the left, right, and center, spanning
decades and borders. It’s UK-heavy because that’s my lens, but I’m sure there are more out there worth naming. In no
particular order, just as they popped into my head:
